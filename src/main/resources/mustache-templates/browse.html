		<p>This SMART on FHIR application demonstrates the ability to find and report suspected phenotypes 
		for a patient based on clinical data retrieved from a FHIR server. Patient lab results are 
		retrieved and converted to terms in the <a href="https://hpo.jax.org/app/">Human Phenotype Ontology</a>. 
		The phenotypes can be appended to the patient record in FHIR for analysis and diagnostics.</p>
